# GitHub Issue Sizing

It is important to keep in mind that each time a new team member joins the
team we will need to reiterate the size definitions. We will also need to
reevaluate the team understanding of size to include the ideas and
understandings of the new team members.

## Size

1. Extra Small - Most requirements are understood, relatively easy, likely
completed in a day or less.

1. Small - A little bit of thought and effort required, similar work has been
done before, or it is extra small but there is a small unknown.

1. Medium - Similar work has been done before, it is clear what needs to be
done, a few extra steps beyond a small.

1. Large - Similar work has not been done recently, this is complex, will
often require assistance from other team members, commonly the largest size
done in a sprint.

1. Extra Large - Similar work has not been done before, might require
research, this is going to take a lot of time, there is considerable risks
that could block this from finishing in one sprint, will require extra team
members to work on it.

1. Epic/Milestone - this needs to be broken down into multiple issues.

## Process

1. Similar to Agile, but how we decide on size is a little different.

1. Senior Developer/Scrum master selects a ticket they feel is a good Medium
issue.

1. Team then sizes in comparison to the initial medium issue using the size
definitions above as a second guide.

    1. With Scrum Master throwing out defining questions and or suggestions.

1. If Issues are too large and need to be in the sprint they are broken down
prior to end of sprint planning.

    1. Often done in backlog grooming prior to a sprint.

## Use

1. The first Sprint we will just be adding sizes to all of our issues for
that sprint.

1. The second Sprint this will include the above and calculating how many of
each size we fit into the previous sprint.

1. The third Sprint we will do all the above and calculate how many of each
size is in the next sprint.

1. The Fourth Sprint we will do all the above and use the calculation to reject
some issues that are drastically larger than previous sprints or add more if
drastically smaller.

1. Future sprints we will repeat step 4 until we start to estimate our sprints
better or we decide we need to try a different sizing style because this style
does not/no longer fits our needs.
